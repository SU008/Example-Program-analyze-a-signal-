# Simple-Program-analyze-signal-characteristics



This program reads in file called "sinewave.csv" which contins the measured amplitude of a signal depending on the sampling frequency. 


The main pupose of the code is to find the highest amplitude.
It can also print out values for:
        The amplitude(highest) is  = X
        total number of samples is = X
        total time                 = X 
        period                     = X 
        fequency is                = X
